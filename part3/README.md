# Part 3 - Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

#### The material developed during part 3 of the full stack course promoted by the University of Helsinki can be found here.

<br>

In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We implemented a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data was stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we deployed our application to the internet.
