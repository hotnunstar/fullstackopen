# Part 7 - React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack

#### The material developed during part 7 of the full stack course promoted by the University of Helsinki can be found here.

In this part, we started by getting familiar with React Router. React Router helps us divide the application into different views that are displayed based on the URL in the browser's address bar. After that, we explored several ways to add CSS styles to React applications.

During the entire course, we have used Vite to build all of our applications. However, it is also possible to configure the entire toolchain, and in this section, we learned how to do this with a tool called Webpack.

Additionally, we explored hook functions and how to define a custom hook.
