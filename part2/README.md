# Part 2 - Communicating with server

#### The material developed during part 2 of the full stack course promoted by the University of Helsinki can be found here.

In this part, we took a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we took a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.
