As applications grow larger, state management should be moved outside React components. In this part, we introduced the Redux library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React applications.

We learned about the lightweight version of Redux directly supported by React, namely the React context and useReducer hook, as well as the React Query library which simplifies server state management.
