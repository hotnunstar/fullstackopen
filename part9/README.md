# Part 9 - TypeScript

#### The material developed during part 9 of the full stack course promoted by the University of Helsinki can be found here.

In this part, we have used the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem, with predefined linters and an existing codebase, while writing TypeScript. After doing this part, we have been able to understand, develop and configure projects using TypeScript.
